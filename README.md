# where do i remove covid🤔

ill teach you how first,

Disconnect the machine from the network to prevent further spread.

Do not run the executable again — every execution risks more damage.

Power down the infected system if you suspect it’s active.

Use trusted antivirus/antimalware tools: Boot from a clean rescue disk (like Windows Defender Offline or Malwarebytes boot media) to attempt removal.

Restore from backups: The only guaranteed way to recover encrypted files is restoring from clean backups made before infection.

Reinstall the OS: If backups aren’t available, wiping the drive and reinstalling Windows is the safest way to ensure the ransomware is gone.

Don’t pay the ransom: There’s no guarantee attackers will decrypt your files.

Don’t try to “clean” the binary manually: Ransomware often hides in multiple locations and may reinfect.

now your all done.
